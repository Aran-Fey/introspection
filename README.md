## Introduction

This module is a collection of new or improved introspection functions.

Some functions are improved versions of the functions found in the [inspect module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html), others are completely new.

A list of all available functions can be found in [the docs](https://aran-fey.github.io/introspection/build/html/index.html).
