   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to introspection's documentation!
=========================================

|

This module is a collection of new or improved introspection functions.

Some functions are improved versions of the functions found in the `inspect module <https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html>`_, others are completely new.

|

Since this just a collection of largely unrelated functions, the documentation will simply list all the available functions.
